# Energy-Efficiency-Energy-Usage-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-in-New-York-City
New York City (NYC) is a densely populated urban environment and as such, the buildings in the city have extraordinary energy consumption. As the number of building constructions shoots up in the city, so does the energy consumption. This project is an attempt to understand this consumption in buildings and the various factors, such as location and property type, that impact it. The project is divided into three main parts. In the first part we will discuss the effectiveness of energy efficiency measures in different property types in the city. In the second part, we will focus on the influence of various building characteristics on energy consumption patterns in the city. Understanding these two things will help in finding the drivers of high energy consumption and potentially set us up to understand sustainability efforts better. Lastly, we will generate predictions for average greenhouse gas emissions in buildings that are currently under construction in NYC. This is important to understand the environmental impact of constructions currently underway.
